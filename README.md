# QuickDefuse 1.0  
  
Implementation of a QuickDefuse Defuse plugin for CS2 using CounterStrikeSharp  
<https://docs.cssharp.dev/>  
  
This plugin allowes defuse the bomb by cut wires (1 - green, 2- yellow, 3 - red, 4 - blue, 5 - random)
- if cut right wire, the bomb will be defused immediately.
- if cut wrong wire, the bomb will explode
- until a wire is chosen after planting, the wire color will be random.
- you can choose the color in chat by typing, for example, !1.
- It is STRONGLY recommended to use the MenuHotkey plugin from my repository. With it, you can instantly select a wire in the pop-up menu. (and it works with every menu)
